# An analysis of time saved after new lines and stations were built in the SMRT railway route
This repository is a small project of mine that compares the time required to move between lines before and after lines like the Circle Line or Thomson-East Coast Line were operational.

In this, I am practicing (and also demonstrating) my ability to perform:

1) Web scraping (pd.read_html)
2) Data cleaning (Sorting stations into lines and emplacing 'NA' into cells that don't have a line attached)
3) Data visualisation (Bar chart to show amount of stations in different lines)
4) Data analysis using Dijkstra's Algorithm (Calculating the shortest path from one station to another)

I used Jupyter Notebook as my IDE with Pandas, NumPY and matplotlib libraries to enhance the results of my analyses, and also to understand the back-end of how an application like Google Maps calculates for you the shortest distance required for your journey.
