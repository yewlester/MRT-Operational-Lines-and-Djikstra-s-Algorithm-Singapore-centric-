# MRT-Operational-Lines-and-Djikstra-s-Algorithm-Singapore-centric-
This repository is a small project of mine that allows a deep dive into the operational stations that the Singapore MRT has, and allows analysis of how many stations exist and what are the shortest paths from point A to B.

In this, I am practicing (and also demonstrating) my ability to perform:

1) Web scraping (pd.read_html)
2) Data cleaning (Sorting stations into lines and emplacing 'NA' into cells that don't have a line attached)
3) Data visualisation (Bar chart to show amount of stations in different lines
4) Data analysis using Djikstra's Algorithm (Calculating the shortest path from one station to another)

I used Jupyter Notebook as my IDE with Pandas, NumPY and matplotlib libraries to enhance the results of my analyses, and also to understand the basic level of how an application like Google Maps calculates for you the shortest distance required for your journey.
