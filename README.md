# MRT-Operational-Lines-and-Djikstra-s-Algorithm-Singapore-centric-
This repository is a small project of mine that allows a deep dive into the operational stations that the Singapore MRT has, and allows analysis of how many stations exist and what are the shortest paths from point A to B.

I have separated the code into different tab to showcase the different types of data analysis that I am performing.
